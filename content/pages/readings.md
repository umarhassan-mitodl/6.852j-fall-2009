## Texts

### Required

The primary source will be the book *Distributed Algorithms* by Prof. Nancy Lynch.

\[Lynch\] = Lynch, Nancy. *Distributed Algorithms*. Burlington, MA: Morgan Kaufmann, 1996. ISBN: 9781558603486.

Errata ({{% resource_link f6ec6a72-ce07-2257-3b3c-d087cfbecafb "PDF" %}})

This book has gone through many printings, but we have made no changes since the fourth printing, so fourth printings or later are just fine. Known errata for early printings are collected in errata lists. The book refers to many papers from the research literature on distributed algorithms; you might want to track down and read some of these.

### Recommended

Other books that you will find useful are:

\[Attiya and Welch\] = Attiya, Hagit, and Jennifer Welch. *Distributed Computing: Fundamentals, Simulations, and Advanced Topics*. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Wiley-Interscience, 2004. ISBN:9780471453246.

This is another textbook on distributed algorithms, initially published a little after the Lynch book. It now has a second edition. The material covered overlaps quite a lot with the Lynch book, though Attiya and Welch do cover some topics, like clock synchronization, that Lynch does not cover. The style is a little less formal.

\[Herlihy and Shavit\] = Herlihy, Maurice, and Nir Shavit. *The Art of Multiprocessor Programming*. Burlington, MA: Morgan Kaufmann, 2008. ISBN: 9780123705914.

This undergraduate textbook covers basic algorithms and techniques for multiprocessor programming.

\[Guerraoui and Kapalka\] = Guerraoui, Rachid, and Michal Kapalka. *Transactional Memory: The Theory*. San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool, 2010. ISBN: 9781608450114.

This monograph presents basic theoretical results about the possibility and costs of implementing transactional memory for shared-memory multiprocessors.

\[Dolev\] = ![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif) Dolev, Shlomi. *Self-Stabilization*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000. ISBN: 9780262041782.

This book gives a good description of self-stabilizing distributed algorithms. Self-stabilization is a strong kind of fault-tolerance, which we will study near the end of the course.

Kaynar, Disun, Nancy Lynch, Roberto Segala, and Frits Vaandrager. *The Theory of Timed I/O Automata*. 2nd ed. San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool, 2010. ISBN: 9781608450022.

This monograph presents a basic modeling framework, Timed I/O Automata (TIOA), for describing and analyzing distributed algorithms.

In addition, some research papers that are not covered in the textbook will be covered in class and on problem sets. These papers are listed in the [supplementary readings](#Supplementary_Readings).

Dijkstra Prize papers
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

In each of the years 2000-2009, a prize has been awarded to a research paper that has had a strong impact on research in the area of distributed algorithms. The prize was originally called the "PODC Influential Paper Award." After the death of Edsger Dijkstra, one of the pioneers of the field, in August 2002, the prize was renamed the "Dijkstra Prize."

We will study the key contributions of most of these papers during this semester. In case you want to read the original papers for yourselves, here is a list:

### Wait-free computability and the wait-free consensus hierarchy

This paper popularized the notion of wait-free computability, and also introduced the wait-free consensus hierarchy.

Herlihy, Maurice. "Wait-Free Synchronization." *ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems* 13, no. 1 (January 1991): 124-149.

This paper presents an interesting observation about the wait-free consensus hierarchy.

### Failure detectors, consensus, and set consensus

The idea of a "failure detector" was introduced in the following paper, which also shows how certain failure detectors can be used to solve consensus.

Chandra, Tushar Deepak, and Sam Toueg. "Unreliable Failure Detectors for Reliable Distributed Systems." *Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery* 43, no. 2 (March 1996): 225-267.

Lamport's "Paxos" paper solves consensus, essentially assuming an underlying failure detector service:

Lamport, Leslie. "The Part-Time Parliament." *ACM Transactions on Computer Systems* 16, no. 2 (May 1998): 133-169. Also available as Research Report 49, Digital Equipment Corporation Systems Research Center, Palo Alto, CA, September 1989.

The following paper proves that a certain failure detector is provably "weakest" for solving consensus:

Chandra, Tushar Deepak, Vassos Hadzilacos, and Sam Toueg. "The Weakest Failure Detector for Solving Consensus." *Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery* 43, no. 4 (July 1996): 685-722.

There are several new papers on failure detectors for set consensus, starting with this one:

Guerraoui, Rachid, Maurice Herlihy, Petr Kouznetsov, Nancy Lynch, and Calvin Newport. "On the Weakest Failure Detector Ever." *Distributed Computing* 21, no. 5 Special Issue (February 2009): 353-366.

Multiprocessor programming

The brand-new Herlihy-Shavit textbook covers the principles of multiprocessor programming quite thoroughly:

Herlihy, Maurice, and Nir Shavit. *The Art of Multiprocessor Programming*. Burlington, MA: Morgan Kaufmann, 2008. ISBN: 9780123705914.

This paper introduced the MCS (Mellor-Crummey Scott) queue lock, which is fast, scalable and fair in a wide variety of multiprocessor systems.

Self-stabilization
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Dijkstra's breakthrough paper originated the idea of distributed algorithm self-stabilization:

Attiya, Hagit, and Jennifer Welch. *Distributed Computing: Fundamentals, Simulations, and Advanced Topics*. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Wiley-Interscience, 2004. ISBN: 9780471453246.

The following paper and thesis contain a lower bound on "gradient" clock synchronization. The thesis chapter is more up-to-date than the journal paper.

Fan, Rui, and Nancy Lynch. "Gradient Clock Synchronization." *Distributed Computing* 18, no. 4 (March 2006): 255-266.

Fan, Rui. "Gradient Clock Lower Bound." Chapter 2 in *Lower Bounds in Distributed Computing*. PhD dissertation, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, February 2008.

The following monograph contains basic formal modeling and proof methods for timing-based systems. It provides the mathematical foundation for the Tempo toolset that we will use in this course.
